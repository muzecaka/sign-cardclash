## 🎮 What is Sign Card Clash? 🎮

Picture a grid of face-down cards, each hiding a number, a special power, or a game-changing “infinite” card. You pick one per round, wait for the big reveal, and score points based on what you get. It’s a mix of strategy (choose wisely!), luck (what’s under that card?), and speed (beat the timer!). The player with the most points at the end wins the crown! 🏆

Here’s the vibe:
- **Cards**: Number cards (1–25), special cards (like wild cards), or the rare “infinite” card. Each has a unique effect on your score! ✨
- **Turns**: Players take turns picking cards. A timer keeps things spicy! ⏰
- **Scoring**: Revealed cards give points. Numbers add directly, specials might multiply or steal points, and the infinite card? Total game-changer! 💪
- **Chat**: Trash-talk or cheer your friends in the chat box. 💬
- **Champion**: Survive eliminations and top the leaderboard to win! 🥇

## 🃏 How to Play Like a Boss 🃏

Time to shine! Here’s how to pick cards, score points, and outsmart your rivals.

### Step 3: Pick a Card 🎴
1. You’ll see a grid of face-down cards, like this:

   🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏   🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏   🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏 🃏
2. Wait for your turn—your name (e.g., “CardShark”) will highlight with “Your Turn!” 🔔
3. Tap a card to pick it. It’s like choosing a mystery prize! 🎁
- *Example*: Tap a card in the middle row. It’ll show “Picked” until the reveal.
4. A timer (usually 30 seconds) counts down. Pick fast, or the game chooses a random card for you! ⏳

- **Strategy Tip**: No clue what’s under the card? Pick one near the edge or middle to mix it up. Trust your gut! 😉

### Step 4: Reveal the Cards! 🌟
1. Once everyone picks (or the host triggers it), cards flip to show their values.
- *Example*:
  ```
  Before: 🃏
  After:  [10]  (10 points!)
  Or:  [Special: Double]  (Doubles your score!)
  Or:  [Infinite]  (Big bonus or wild effect!)
  ```
2. Your score updates based on the card. Numbers add points directly, specials might boost or mess with scores, and the infinite card can shake up the game!

- **Fun Fact**: Cards animate when they flip, and special ones might zoom in for extra flair! 🎉

### Step 5: Track Your Score 📊
- After the reveal, check your score near your name:

  CardShark: 25 points  PointMaster: 18 points  GameBoss: 30 points
- The leaderboard shows everyone’s rank. Stay sharp to climb to the top! 📈

### Step 6: Keep Playing Rounds 🔄
- Each round, you pick a new card, reveal, and score. Rounds keep going until the game ends (set by the host or max rounds).
- Some players might get eliminated (like a knockout in a tournament). Stay in to win!

- **Host Controls**: If you’re the host, you can:
- Reveal cards manually (“Reveal Cards” button).
- Start the next round (“Next Round”).
- Save or reset the game. You’re the game master! 🎮
