🎮 Game Overview
Sign Card Clash lets 2-10 players compete to earn the highest score by picking cards in turn-based rounds. The host creates a game with a 6-character code, and players join via a sleek web interface. Pick from a deck of 30 cards (25 valued 1-25, 4 valued 30, 1 valued 50), avoid elimination, and aim to be the last player standing. Spectators can watch, and a real-time chat keeps the vibe lively!

🧠 AI Techniques Used
The client leverages AI-driven features for a smooth experience:

Randomized Card Display: Cards are shuffled server-side (Fisher-Yates algorithm) and displayed dynamically in React, ensuring fair visuals.
Real-Time State Sync: Socket.IO integrates with React to update game state (e.g., card picks, leaderboards) instantly, using state management for consistency.
Automated Notifications: React Toastify delivers smart feedback (e.g., “Game created! Code: ABC123”) based on server events.

⚙️ Game Mechanics
Scoring System

Card Values: 25 cards (1-25), 4 cards (30), 1 card (50).
Scoring: Players pick one card per round, adding its value to their score. Highest score wins.
Tiebreakers: Ties for lowest score are broken by slowest pick time, adding urgency.

AI Behaviors

No NPCs: Purely multiplayer, with human-driven strategy.
Client-Side Automation: The client syncs with server-driven auto-assignment (for missed turns) and displays real-time updates (e.g., card reveals).

Level Progression

Rounds: Players pick cards in turn; lowest scorer is eliminated each round.
Turn Order: Based on leaderboard (highest score picks first).
Endgame: Last player standing is the champion, or no winner if all are eliminated.
